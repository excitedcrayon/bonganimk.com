## Overview

[Website Link](https://bonganimk.com/)

This is a small project that I worked on to create my single web page website using the following;

* PHP
* HTML 
* NodeJS
* ES5 / ES6
* SCSS/CSS
* SMTP Relay using GMAIL

### Dependancy packages/libraries used
* [Node-Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).
NodeJS was used to compile the SCSS pre-processor into CSS

### Animations
The animations across the entire project are developed using native JS code and css transitions.

**/js/libs/Canvas.js** | handles the **<canvas>** animation
**/js/libs/ParallaxEffec.js** | handles the vertical|horizontal line animations using CSS translate that is triggered on *window* scroll
